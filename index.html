The clouds above her apartment roof created a second roof, covering the drab neighborhood in a flat dimness, lacking in distinction between light and shadow. Esse was still waking up. She reflexively extended her arm over the couch edge to tap her Datanow which was resting on the floor. The model was not new, but not obviously outdated - it boasted the same semi-translucent material, featureless surface, and cube shape. It released a hologram above, revealing specks of dust slowly finding their way to the ground, and an informational screen telling the time, her quality of sleep, and various messages, including one from Daniel. 

The lethargy from napping eventually faded, and she walked to the window to gaze at the street. The apartment she had been living in was a misfit, at least she always believed so. All the other houses appeared to have resided there for decades, with crumbling facades and scraggly, sad trees. This building must have been made or renovated somewhat recently, since the paint was fresh and bright and the bushes were healthy-looking and full. There was one flaw though, a single crack; a secret she has kept with the building alone. It slightly alters each day she inspects it, reminding her of a signature, rewritten with the same hand and always indecipherable. 

Turning her eyes upward at the overcast, she let out a silent sigh. Somewhere behind the clouds the sky was darkening gradually, the sun’s last rays stored away behind the horizon. But she didn’t mind missing it. The heavy clouds resonated more with her current mood. Despite a long nap, she was still exhausted from a sleepless night. She made the mistake of working too late, fulfilling at-home Data Sorting tasks on her Datanow, and her brain was fully warmed up and active by the middle of the night. Daniel was still up as usual. He sent a message, filled with didactic and esoteric language, similar to his scientific abstracts. While she considered herself a careful listener, sometimes all their conversations would blend together until she could hardly distinguish them or when they had happened. He would give an abundant flow of information, unaware, or maybe dismissant, of the amount of complex hypotheses he filled a room with. Some people found this inspiring, including the CEO of Earthdata, while others felt as though they were constantly swimming upstream. Earthdata truly was where he was suited best, surrounded by and funneling information, free to test his theories among professionals. Esse herself had been working in the Datanow branch as a Data Sorter for about three months, which was not her first choice but she was grateful for it nonetheless.

She poked her cheek and tried to remember what Daniel was talking about last night. <i>Something about Dallas Raines...Oh, yes, he had breakfast with him. Then there was poparazzi, which Mr Raines was smiling and gracious about, waving off the crowd like a predicted warm front. Then he set up his equipment at Signal Hill. A metallic device perched atop a grassy hill, like a lonely sightseer, watching the city darken and disappear into dots of street lights. That’s the summary anyways. I wonder if he has another story to tell me today.</i>

The Datanow lit up again, and she indicated to open the message: <i>“Could I stop by tonight?” </i>
She’d have to wake up a little more and liven her tired appearance, but she had no plans. She told the device: <i>“Sure.”</i>

Esse normally liked to have lunch around noon, but today she’d been sleeping. Her fridge was looking sparse, since she hadn’t been to the grocery store this week yet. In a small pot she placed a chicken drumstick, a few cups of water, some salt and pepper, and the last shriveled thumb of ginger to make a soup broth. When the broth was fragrant with chicken and spicy ginger, in went a chopped up stalk of tired celery, a carrot, and a potato. As she stirred the plain soup, Daniel’s words circled around in her mind. She hadn’t asked why he was visiting, she often hosted him or Penny at the apartment whenever they pleased. The place was minimal and not really suitable for hosting, but Esse wasn’t discontent with it. The square living room suited the few guests she kept, the kitchen was unassuming but equipped, the windows took in each day’s sunlight, and she was lucky to have quiet neighbors above and below her floor. Daniel often said he preferred her practical taste to the grand studios of the elite parties he occasionally attended. 

She wasn’t intentionally sparing with her possessions, or living on meager salary. Her job paid sufficiently for her every need, and with the extra money she often moved it to savings. Spending never brought her much joy, besides the exceptional book to add to her library. The same followed with her groceries - she bought in modest portions, once a week. Yet she’d neglected to go today, so her pantry was even slimmer than usual. With one of the few pieces of slightly stale bread, she made toast to eat with her soup. Outside the kitchen window, the clouds revealed a single patch of the evening sky (now a deep navy blue) that seemed reluctant to disappear. Esse watched as the patch was inevitably shrunk by its neighbors. By the time she was done eating and about to clear her dishes, it had vanished, punctuated by ringing from her Datanow. Placing her dishes in the sink, she knew it was Daniel. Instead of picking up she headed straight for the door; he always called as soon as he was at the door, he never knocked. 

“Hey Esse, what have you been up to this apocalyptic set of days? I forgot to tell you yesterday, HQ says the overcast is unusually stubborn lately because the cumulonimbus behind all these stratocumulous are still forming. You look kinda sleepy, did you get any rest last night?”

“Mmm..not really. I’ve been napping.” He remained standing in the kitchen with her, observing her practiced movements. She filled the kettle with water and switched it on. “What about you?”

He shrugged then leaned against the fridge. “A bit, but you know me. I keep running now matter how little I sleep. HQ says the Earth-Core equipment will be ready to test in a few days so I’ll be back at Signal for the week. Should be a tidal wave of data coming in; the last time they drilled so far was in the 1960’s, during the oil surplus. And I’m far from complaining, I’ll be able to visit you more often, if you would allow me to drink all your tea. But first I-” he paused as she poured the boiling hot water, “wanted to ask you a question.”

“Yeah?” Her voice wavered slightly. It was unusual for him to ask the questions, they were Esse’s vocabulary. But she soon dismissed it. Daniel had asked odd things before - once he requested to borrow a book of poetry from her library. It was a Borzutzky anthology she’d bought some time ago from a second hand store, filled with Borzutzky’s lucid-dream, grossly descriptive imagery he uses to elucidate the dirt of the country. Not something she enjoyed reading on a regular basis, so she didn’t mind if he kept it for a month. 

“Well, have you ever just thought about the cycles of nature, like the hydraulic cycle for example, and wondered how they used to sustain us? How each part magically did its job, and thus created life?” His voice dipped slightly, almost making the question mark silent. “It’s made me think about everything in terms of systems. Everything was created by some system, and things that survive have stronger, sometimes timeless, systems. The water molecules would evaporate into the clouds, the clouds kept moving until stopped by fronts or mountains, gather and release rain, create rivers to the sea, where the water would be evaporated again.”

Though his mouth opened, Daniel stopped and didn’t say anything, using the silence to regather his thoughts. He took a sip of tea then massaged his chin as if he was trying to memorize its surface. She held her cup with both hands, in patient suspension for him to continue. 

“My own systems have been lacking. I’ve always felt that I’m missing one element, one part of the world, which would complete me. But lately, it’s become more apparent, and I fear an eventual collapse or internal environmental disaster that will be difficult to recover from. No amount of data engineers or collectors or sorters could prevent this from happening. Except for that one thing.”

Daniel’s green eyes were lost in the night outside the window, but now turned to pierce into her own. She felt a chill pass through her core. “A-And you know what that is?”

Blinking mechanically but maintaining an intense gaze, he smiled with a glow she’d never seen before. It reminded her of the face of a child remembering a remarkably good dream they had, certain they’ll have it again. But now it was as if she was somehow intertwined with this dream, or being sucked into it by the force of his magnetic pupils. Esse found herself spinning from the inside and held onto her tea a bit tighter. 

“Come on Esse, I thought you would have guessed that part. I want you. I want to keep you as my own. I want to become a part of the same system, a powerful system that may endure farther than our own lives. Esse, I know you may not see it now, but I need exactly what you have, and I can give you what you need. We each share what the other lacks - like … - we could shift the entire world.”

Now her stomach decided to morph itself into what felt like a condensed sphere, making her suddenly nauseous. She had never dwelled on what she knew was lacking in her life. It had become a part of the background, the blocks of color to offset the foreground of her everyday life. Sure, her job was routine and often uninspiring, but it provided consistency. Her world consisted of her apartment, her office, and Penny and Daniel. Esse had other friends in school, and several cousins and grandparents, but she had often considered them to be acquaintances at most, and preferred to be solitary. When she was a child, her mother would always be pulling her back into a social setting, usually a group of her mother’s friends or relatives, but it didn’t seem to matter. She never truly felt like they were there, seeing and hearing the reality they were in. If she was being honest, she believed most people acted like the grey and white clouds that never rain, snow, or hail. They wait around, doing what they think suits them, then vanish. 

Daniel was definitely here, more here than anyone she’d ever talked to. His voice had dropped a weight over the air, silencing all white noise; even the refrigerator went still. <i>What do I really feel about him? Is it love? Is it completeness? I cannot tell. His personality is such a heavy shape. Mine has longed to find solid ground for so long, for another person in this reality, I’ve forgotten some things...but there is too much uncertainty here.</i>

“I think I want something too. But I cannot say it is what you can give, ” Her eyes twitched once, and she placed her tea down on the counter. “The ground is still new.” Their eye contact broke briefly, and she thought she felt a tremor from the tile floor under her foot. 

“New or not, there is an obvious energy - do you not feel it?” It was as if he just read her thoughts. “Esse, I understand your caution. You've always been a cautious person. But do know, I don't aim to disappear.”

There was not much else she could think of to say. For a few minutes they finished their tea in the quiet kitchen, illuminated by the steady yellow light shining from the ceiling spotlights. After placing the empty mugs in the sink, they bid farewells and she watched him being absorbed by the night. Yet he was right. Esse knew he never really left.
