  	OCT - 11
</p>
<p>
My arm was twitching terribly again, so I decided to give up napping any longer. Above my roof, the sky was covered by its own roof of clouds, darkening the drab neighborhood. The house I live in must look like a piece of Ikea furniture in a thrift shop - the square building was recently repainted and lined with crisply trimmed little bushes, while the rest of the street only has scraggly trees and facades that peel from neglect. I doubt many passersby, if any, know about the squiggly earthquake-signed crack, as it is well hidden behind a perfectly-sized shrub. I’d noticed it when the gardener had forgotten to trim a stray branch, so I completed the job with a pair of scissors. For some reason, I began to feel like it was my secret, and now I check behind the bush every day when I walk back from work. Sometimes it looks slightly different than the previous day, like a signature re-written with the same hand. </p>
<p>
Everything looked the same outside the window because of the overcast. When I held my phone to my face, my eyes watered from the screen’s brightness. It was 4:08 PM, two hours since I gave up reading an email from Penny and turned parallel to the sofa, and one hour since I’d received a message from Daniel. I tried to remember what we’d texted about last night; sometimes all his stories mixed up in my head, but I could recall his opening line:
</p>
<i>Well, I had breakfast with Dallas Raines and tested my homemade weather station at the Don Edwards wildlife refuge</i>
<p>
I remember enjoying his following messages, as they were filled with mundane adventure, without his usual dramatics. Apparently, his Sunday began in an IHOP with Mr. Raines, who accumulated a subtle amount of poparazzi, waving fans off with a wide smile, then transitioned to an afternoon on the flat expanse of marsh, where he set up some metal device, and could only hear the distant sound of cars on a freeway and an occasional small bird. 
 </p>
This morning however he was more plain than usual:
<p>
<i>could I stop by tonight?
</p>
sure. just took a super long nap</i>
<p>
For my extremely late lunch, I heated up a bowl of soup I’d made the day before and poured some crackers in. I didn’t ask Daniel why he wanted to visit. My apartment accepted visitors whenever; Penny would come over randomly as well so I wasn’t disturbed. Finishing the soup, sip by sip, I slowly nibbled at the crackers. Perhaps he wanted to explain his extraordinarily eventful week in person. I returned to my laptop to check my emails, occasionally freeing my eyes to the window. There was a tiny patch of blue I hadn’t noticed before, revealing the true, deepening color of the sky. While sending several emails, I kept glancing at it until it was overtaken by its neighbors.
</p>
Just then my phone began buzzing. Daniel was calling, so I ran to the door. 
<p>
“Hey E! Wow, you look like you’ve been asleep all day.” He gave me a light hug.
<p></p>
“Yeah, most of it.”
<p></p>
I led him to the kitchen and sliced an orange twice the size of my fist to share. He grinned at me and took a piece.
<p></p>
“So what’s up with this week?”
<p></p>
He swallowed the last segment and placed the rind on the counter.
<p></p>
“Well, I actually wanted to ask you a question.”
<p></p>
“Yeah?” This was very unusual, and I found myself generating possible directions, all of which lead to a deserted, unknown area. 
<p></p>
“Well, have you ever counted how many words there are total in all the texts we’ve sent each other?”
<p></p>
This wasn’t it. There was no doubt that this wasn’t important and his would take up a much higher word count. I shook my head.
<p></p>
He motioned that he was going to sit down.
<p></p>
Daniel had slightly above average length legs that remind me of an insect when he sat cross-legged. Today though, we sat on the couch, our knees aligned like dots that were meant to be connected. We finished the oranges, then he turned towards me and gave a humble expression, and I could’ve sworn I noticed slight worry holding up his eyebrows.
<p></p>
“Thanks for always feeding me by the way, E. You’re the only person who always gives me healthy food, and I need it.” 
<p></p>
I said it was no problem, it was nice to share my snacks with people. This still wasn’t a question though.
<p></p>
“But, you’re, um, always casual and generous with everything. You’re like a cumulus cloud. And really cute.” 
<p></p>
“Oh, thanks.” Weird compliment assortment, and weirder expression he was morphed into. His brows kept skewing, quivering slightly. 
<p></p>
“Sometimes I think you’re like a cirrostratus cloud. They’re rare, as they encircle the sun and disappear easily.”
<p></p>
“Pretty sure I’m not going anywhere. Are you worried about something?” 
<p></p>
I double checked that my own forehead was relaxed, free of the slight crease that sometimes appeared above my brow.
<p></p>
His brows raised further upwards, then he straightened his face out and looked serious. </p>
“Well, E, would you want to go out with me?”
<p>
----
</p>
Of course, I told Daniel I’d think about it. He left with a side hug and a grin. Penny texted me later, and as soon as I told her he’d visited, she surprised me: <i>Oh, did he come over to at last reveal his friendship had turned romantic??</i><br>
She knew, I suppose, what he had been feeling. I wonder if she knows what I feel.</p>
<p>
The details are plain: he’s my second closest friend to Penny. I’ve heard some acquaintances describe him as overly apologetic, with an imbalanced set of nerves that made him constantly fidget, yet those things never bother me. He is always there, a part of my routine; I am trying to imagine how we would be as a couple. And yet, the vision of myself remains blurry, until it evaporates as a cloud. Until it is just Daniel, overwhemling the world below.
</p>

OCT - 12
<p>
I woke up to construction workers drilling the concrete several houses down. As I peeled back my comforter, my phone began vibrating. It was Penny calling, directing me to meet her at our coffee place so she could implement some of her knack for direction into my life. I gathered up an outfit and stepped into the cafe. Since the cafe is practically my second living room, I don’t even need to say a word, simply give the cash and sit down, to receive my cafe latte with soy milk every time. Setting myself at a two-person table in a corner, with my back to a navy-blue wall, I faced towards a green-framed window. I stared into the foam and let my eyes rest. 
</p><p>
“Esse, you look like a Diebenkorn painting.” Penny was holding a black coffee in a wide ceramic cup in one gracefully strong hand while pulling her chair out with the other. 
</p><p>
“Oh, really?” I smiled dumbly, but I could easily envision the exact piece she meant; I’d stared at it when I visited San Francisco last year. 
</p><p>
“You know, <i>Woman and Coffee</i> or something like that.” 
<p></p>
She sat down and leaned forward, her dark eyes directed straight into mine. While most of her features are like a warm, bright day, her eyes are oddly deep and intense.  
<p></p>
“So how are you handling this? Have you responded to him yet?”
<p></p> 
“I’m fine, no not yet.” I turned away, gazing at the confection case that resembled a Wayne Thiebaud piece. She could have been blended into the scene as well, like the strangely stark women that sometimes stood behind his thickly painted counters.
<p></p>
“Hmm. It would be best to tell him soon.”
<p></p>
“Yeah.”
<p></p>
“I always thought you two had a bond, or at least inside jokes I never understood. And you know his parents.” 
<p></p>
I imagined Thanksgiving with his family circled around me, handing me food and expecting details in return. My stomach felt like it was morphing into a different shape. 
<p></p>
“What’s that odd face about?”
<p></p>
“Oh, my coffee is already lukewarm.” I took a sip and blinked. 
<p></p>
“Sorry I kept you waiting. Had to take a phone call with someone I’m interviewing this week.”
She sipped her own coffee and stared off, allowing an intermission of a few minutes. 
<p></p>
“I really hope you’re ok, Esse. It must be strange, as you practically lost a best friend. Remember you can call me whenever you need reassurance or guidance on anything, or just a person around.”
<p></p>
“Thanks Penny, I’m really going to be fine.”
<p></p>
“Alright.” That was the end of her motherly advice for the day. Thankfully, she set the topic aside.
“Did you ever end up listening to the Impromptu piano works of Schubert?”
<p></p>
I nodded and placed down my empty cup, forming my hands to a perfect circle around the base. Her and Daniel are the foundation of my music taste. She influenced me by her preference of classical classics - Tchaikovsky, Shastokovich, Schubert, Brahms, and Debussy. Daniel took me the other direction, introducing me to obscure punk rock bands and inviting me to small shows throughout downtown. Lately though, I’ve been replaying music that you’d probably find on an elevator, or in a hotel lobby. It never really asks to be listened to, and doesn’t have much of a melody; I could listen to it all day. 
<p></p>
“He was quite extraordinary - did I ever tell you how he composed his works? He stopped using a piano, just wrote the notes straight on the sheets. So crazy and talented, he thought the piano got in the way. I couldn’t imagine working without my piano equivalent, skipping an outline before writing anything.” 
<p></p>
Penny has been stationed at the local newspaper as a journalist for nearly 4 years, covering philosophy and everything related in her direct and intense style. I can’t imagine her writing without a detailed series of paragraphs.
<p></p>
“Not everyone works like Schubert,” I remarked with a thoughtful expression.
<p></p>
“Very true.”
<p></p>
----////----
<p></p>
I pushed aside the refrigerator to examine myself in the mirror. Last night’s earthquake had rearranged the house into an Escher spectacle and relocated it several islands away, but everything inside was still here. My right shoulder was still out of place, making my silhouette appear constantly leaning to the side. 
<p></p>
The mirror shrunk with a clink and attached to my wristband, the surface becoming pixelated like a digital wrist watch. It beeped and digital letters scrolled across the screen: GOOD AFTERNOON EZR- when the second earthquake began. Grabbing onto the kitchen sink, I twisted my wrist and heard the screen crack slightly, and instinctively let go. The world shook me out the window, sending me past the mansions, airports, grocery stores, and neighborhoods, all unempathetic and distant as crisply-painted dollhouses. 
<p></p>
I finally landed in a gridded space that resembled a desperately clean white-tiled bathroom. Ahead of me, a path of green-and-blue tiles began, and led me to a dimly lit, curving escalator. As I descended, the tiles spread above me to become a bright blue day lined with greenery, that seemed to embrace me with familiarity. When I reached the bottom, the escalator froze, and I realized I was at my 27th office. 
<p></p>
A few steps in front of me a narrow creek, or used-to-be-creek, since it was now a dried pathway of dusty rocks, encircled a willow tree. Flowing from the tree, a bedroom-size veil of branches hung heavily, given up waiting for a breeze. I pushed aside the veil and entered the office. I blinked and hardly recognized it, as it had become a sort of storage space for all kinds of office things, being crowded with dressers, files, paper towers, books, boxes, a computer, printer, and a desk with an irrational amount of pens. 
<p></p>
Peeling back a portion of books and paperwork, I pulled out my personal notepad and began documenting all the inventory. Most of the literature were high school classic reads, including editions of Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice, and Much Ado About Nothing. I was skimming the last pages of an edition of The Tale of Two Cities, when something shuffled around. Thinking it was in the desk, I pulled open the drawer and pushed things around but couldn’t find it. As I bent underneath and touched the back panel, it shook again with more clarity; it was inside a hidden compartment behind the panel. With closer inspection, I noticed a keyhole, centered in a brass oval about thumb-size, and a sapphire glass knob attached below. Keys were nowhere in clear sight, so I impatiently yanked at the knob, to no avail. 
<p></p>
Pressing my face against the worn wooden surface, I tried to simply listen. The contents gently shook the whole desk and my head which was now connected to it, and something like the trapped wind in a seashell moved inside.

</p><p>
My face was buzzing and my mind was fully conscious, but my hands had gone numb from holding my arms above my head all night, so I pulled them down and had to stretch my fingers until I knew they were mine again. I found a sticky note in one hand, with pairs of unlikely word combinations scribbled in a column. Probably sleep-writing again; I’ve written small songs in my sleep, most of which never made much sense, and seemed completely unrelated to my daily life. Apparently I’ve become more minimal in my subconscious style.
</p><p>
My phone was near my other hand. No messages appeared; Daniel still hadn’t contacted me. 
</p><p>
I turned my body to slide my feet off the bed and stand up. I stuck the note on the mirror and found my face. Today, I felt slightly more fatigued than usual and tried to remember if my dream had been exhausting. Nothing but a curtain of black came to mind; I haven’t had any dreams ever since moving to my apartment last year, and before that they were all about your typical, stress-inducing events. I’ve shown up to graduation wearing only a shirt, been late for every train to the airport, and crashed every car I drove - so I am not sad to dream of pure darkness. I continued gazing at my reflection, trying to remember if I’ve always been this pale. The features reminded me of a set of ceramic. Like plain dishware for one, the eyebrows neatly rest above the eyes, which are placed at the sides of the moderately smooth nose, all laid out on a predictably shaped table of the face. Only my ears disrupt the still life, like a last minute addition to contribute some conceptual emphasis, they noticeably stick out on either side.
</p><p>
I pressed the DATE button on my watch to confirm it was the second Saturday of the month. One week since Daniel visited me, tainting this one with an anniversary of odd feelings. I hoped my usual weekend routine with Penny, yoga and philosophy at the small park a block away, would sort me out or at least allow me to absorb the sun and feel like an organism, hardly aware of anything but existing, while Penny verbally edited her upcoming article. Working with her in this way would have been overwhelming for some people, but I don’t notice the weight of information; it’s a loose method she depends on to organize her ideas. Disembodying myself is instinctual. Literally losing touch with reality, the only validation of my presence are my ears in their untiring translation of sound waves, and my muscle memory response to nod or shake my head upon recognition of a question.
</p><p>
“Hey, will you be ready soon?”
Penny’s face was sticking through the open window next to my dresser. 
I nodded and pulled the blind down.
</p><p>
Slipping out of my pajamas and into my sweatpants and t-shirt, I checked my weather app. The sunlight pushing out the corners of the blind was eager but deceiving; it has been a modest 60 F lately, hesitantly decreasing as everyone urges on the season by buying sweaters. The week’s forecast looked like the weather person had copy-pasted 53 F, which they really could’ve done and no one would complain, besides Daniel. I shrugged and stuffed a sweater into my tote bag.
</p><p>
At the park, Penny and I rolled out our mats on a slight hill next to a tree. For awhile she sat and stared at the tree, so I followed her gaze to the branches, but nothing stopped my eye. Normally, she’d start talking about now. I stood perpendicular to my mat and pulled myself upwards, with my hands raised and pressed together, and tilted my head back to squint at the sky. There were perhaps four birds at the park today, all up in trees surrounding the edges of the park, occasionally letting a cry to define the boundaries in short chirps. 
</p><p>
“Perfect weather this week. Autumn is undeniably the best season.”
</p><p>
The air was pushed out of my lungs from the bending of my spine, so I mumbled a ‘mhm’.
</p><p>
“Soon it will be November, the herald of the holidays. Have you talked to Daniel yet? He’d probably want to know whether you’re celebrating with him this year.”
</p><p>
I straightened then reversed my bend, so my face touched my knees. My arm began its spasmodic twitching again. “I haven’t, I’ll invite him over today.” 
</p><p>
She watched me unfold myself over the mat, then rise into a downward dog. Except I felt unbalanced with the single shaking arm.
</p><p>
“You are accepting him, right?” Her fingers, unguided by her eyes, began to wander to the edges of her notebook rested upon her legs.
</p><p>
As I shifted weight forwards into an upward dog, only a few inches above the ground but trembling to keep myself from falling, I nodded gently.
</p><p>
“I’m glad for you. Well enough of my interrogation, let me begin explaining the topic of this week’s article.”
</p><p>
Flipping open her notebook, which was worn with curling edges and warped pages, she began by delving into a question about the source of personality and individuality, gradually shifting from various viewpoints - from the scientific view, Christian view, Muslim view, Hindu view, and on. I watched her pinch the terribly misshapen pages, occasionally interrupting to smooth them out and cause a wave of crinkling protest.
</p><p>
Resting my body on the ground, I bent my legs back to connect my feet to my head. Flexibility is one of my achievements. It’s a combination of my natural plasticity and ability to do the same thing every day, regardless if progress is noticeable. Penny continued on, separating internal and external characteristics in the air, tapping on her notebook for emphasis.  
 </p><p>
“In the words of Lafcadio Hearn, ‘I an individual—an individual soul! Nay, I am a population—a population unthinkable for multitude, even by groups of a thousand millions! Generations of generations I am, aeons of aeons!’ With or without a soul, our traits are developed by a multitude of past voices, and, if we agree on the Law of the Conservation of Mass, our physical bodies have an infinity in each corner. We are a center of energy gathered from ages of deterioration and growth, containing the blood, diet, dust of our ancestors and other organisms, and a worldview that contains the time-altered whispers of their ideas. Adding a soul, there is an entirely new dimension that we can never see, with no physical nature or location even as it is attached to us.”
</p><p>
Penny is not necessarily religious, but she collects a wide selection of revered writings. Her living room is walled in by books, which of course are organized by category and last names. When she’s not writing or reading about philosophy and religion, she harnesses her extreme organization into her other career, as an Art Director for the local magazine. 
</p><p>
“While the soul may exist, there is no way for us to study it. No one wonder why most scientists reject it.”
</p><p>
She distractedly glanced at a man wearing a black apron walking down the street. Squinting to narrow her already piercing gaze, she could have been reading his soul, but she soon smiled and waved. Her whole face softened to an unrecognizable arrangement and her eyes slightly dilated; she’d always had an admiration for the guy who ran the coffee shop, something I’d noticed since we first met. 
</p><p>
That day has been recorded in some detail in my previous journals. She was seated beside me, writing on her laptop, when I took a drink of a nearly-finished strong brew and shakily tapped her on the shoulder to ask her if I could share the table. Penny obliged, even venturing to begin a conversation on Seneca of travel as I explained I’d just moved in. It was clear by her lingering grin when she approached the counter  that she wanted to stay right there, to keep staring at him. But she never did ask him out; I came to believe it was a matter of priority. She was extremely busy with two jobs and had probably decided to put relationships aside for awhile. When she concluded her lecture, she expressed her appreciation of how intently I had listened. And so our meetings began. 
</p><p>
 I let a sliver of light into my eyes to indicate that I was still awake. Penny was again gazing outward, obviously not thinking about trees or skies or birds, probably not even anything tangible. 
</p><p>
“Have you ever pictured the soul?” 
</p><p>
She tilted her head as she waited for my response. I kept my arms and legs still in the full sunlight. I had always thought of it intangibly, but I found myself envisioning my innermost being. Perhaps it was a shape, like the cirrostratus cloud, fleeting and hollow in the center.
</p><p>
“Not really.”
</p><p>
My spine had merged with the mat, which was formed to the soft ground; I was a part of the act of being a perfectly arching hill in an otherwise uneventful park. 
</p><p>
“Hmm. If it could be seen, I imagine it’s quite chaotic.”
</p><p>
I didn’t even nod this time. The birds were slowly getting out of sync, singing at random and at overlapping times, so it was hard to sort their voices out anymore.

</p><p>
OCT - 19
</p><p>
I cracked an egg on the counter then split it in two over the hot pan, shoving a piece of bread in the toaster. I set out my only mug and steeped a bag of black tea while watching the egg turn from glossy to opaque. Egg, toast, tea. Most people collect an unreasonable amount of mugs, but I have been able to avoid them, although the one I have needs to be replaced. Instead of a handle it has two sharp nubs that make it difficult to hold when it’s burning hot. But I can’t throw it out. It’s a rare piece of my past that I enjoy keeping around, since it was handmade by a friend, with a beautiful milky-white glaze and a perfectly circular shape.
</p><p>
I titled the mug slightly to watch the leftover tea granules reorganize themselves. Gathering my thoughts to Penny’s easy smile, her clear tone padded by reassurance, I stacked my dishes in the sink and let them soak. She knows what’s best, so it would be best to believe her. Her words formulate into perfect plans that I’ve seen fulfilled on many occasions.
</p><p>
I kept my lips closed and made a hardly audible sigh, void from meaning. Forming my lips to curse, my voice felt like it was suddenly locked in a drawer, and I couldn’t find the key.
</p><p>
I gave up, sensing that the disruptive nature of cussing might break any sort of intangible barrier I’d curated. Who knows whether it would be salvageable after I forced it open, exposing its contents? Half-convinced, I rested my elbows as two 90 degree angles and opened up my laptop screen, opening tabs of my social media accounts. In my email inbox, I sorted through the regular; some subscription service tells me to upgrade so I can read more about “Why You Are Struggling With Productivity”, Twitter notifies me that my account has turned 2, my spam contains an email from a retail position I applied for a month ago, and my promotional material is filled with announcements from an online store I don’t remember subscribing for. </p><p>

I shut my laptop screen, still filled with tabs, and put on my long-day-standing shoes for work. The old-school tennis shoes are the only ones I can walk around in for more than 6 hours. After a slight bend of my wrist to check my watch, the arm twitching revisited, stronger and more persistent like an annoying creature poking me for attention. I extended my arm in front, thinking it might help blood flow. I watched my hand tremble with each spasm. Suddenly my back pocket vibrated, to which my other hand instinctively retrieved my phone and opened the notification.</p><p>
