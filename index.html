OCT - 11
</p><p>

My arm was twitching terribly again, so I decided to give up napping any longer. Above my roof, the sky was covered by its own roof of clouds, darkening the drab neighborhood. The house I live in must look like a piece of Ikea furniture in a thrift shop - the square building was recently repainted and lined with crisply trimmed little bushes, while the rest of the street only has scraggly trees and facades that are peeling. I doubt many people who walk by, if any, know about the squiggly earthquake-signed crack, as it is well hidden behind a perfectly-sized shrub. I’d noticed it when the gardener had forgotten to trim a stray branch, and I completed the job with a pair of scissors. For some reason, I now check behind the bush every time I’m back from another day at EARTHDATA. Sometimes it looks slightly different than the previous day, like a signature re-written with the same hand. 
<p></p>
I held my phone to my face and my eyes watered from the screen’s brightness. It was already near to night time; I’d replied to Data Requests in the morning and slept on the sofa through the afternoon. I think Daniel and I texted until midnight yesterday. Sometimes all his stories mix up in my head, as we tend to have lengthy phone calls, but I am pretty sure his opening line went like:
<p></p>
Well, I had breakfast with Dallas Raines and tested my new EARTHNEWS equipment at Signal Hill
<p></p>
I remember enjoying the rest of our conversation, as he described the adventure poetically, without his usual dramatics. Apparently, his Sunday began in an IHOP with Mr. Raines, who accumulated a modest amount of poparazzi, waving fans off with a wide smile, then transitioned to the top of a grassy hill, where he set up some metal device, and watched the city darken and disappear into dots of street lights.
<p></p>
This time however he was more plain:
<p></p>
<i>could I stop by tonight?</i>
<p></p>
I returned with: <i>sure.</i>
<p></p>
For my extremely late lunch, I heated up a bowl of soup I’d made the day before and poured some crackers in. I didn’t ask Daniel why he wanted to visit. My apartment accepted visitors whenever; Penny would come over randomly as well so I wasn’t disturbed. I reasoned, perhaps he wanted to explain his extraordinarily eventful week in person. Finishing the soup, I nibbled at the crackers, occasionally freeing my eyes to the window. There was a tiny patch of sky I hadn’t noticed before, revealing the true, deep navy color of the sky. It was bound to be overtaken by its neighbors.
<p></p>
That instant my phone began buzzing. Daniel was at my doorstep. 
<p></p>
“Hey E! The overcast is unusually dense today, perhaps there are cumulonimbus behind these stratocumulus. What have you been doing this dim day?” He gave me a light hug.
<p></p>
“Mhm. I’ve been napping.” I went to the kitchen to prepare tea and spoke to him across the island counter. “What’s the weekend report?”
<p></p>
He came around the counter to lean on the fridge. “HQ says the reconfigured Earth-Core equipment will be ready to test in a couple days, so I’ll be back at Signal for the week. Should be a tidal wave of Data when it comes to collecting, as the last time they drilled at Signal Hill was in the 1960’s, during the oil surplus. So I’ll be within radius to visit you more frequently, if you’ll allow me to reduce your tea supply. But I..” He paused as I poured the boiling water, “Well, I wanted to ask you a question.”
<p></p>
“Yeah?” Unusual, but I dismissed it as he had dramatically asked me to recommend a book of poetry to him once. I lent him my antique copy of a Borzutzky collection. 
<p></p>
“Well, have you ever considered how the mechanical systems of earth, such as the hydrologic cycle, would simply run, yet sustained us all?”
<p></p>
Technically, this was a question, but it was not <i>the</i> question. I often didn’t think of historical weather systems anymore, since it’s nearly all regulated now. Also, I know many natural disasters used to devastate whole islands, so I don’t have as pure a view of cloud formation as Daniel does. I shook my head. 
<p></p>
Daniel has slightly above average length legs that remind me of an insect when he sits cross-legged. Today though, we sat on the couch. We hesitantly sipped the steaming tea, and I could’ve sworn I noticed slight worry holding up his eyebrows.
<p></p>
“I’ve been thinking about the parts that sustain my own systems. You’ve definitely taken a vital part, perhaps to the extent of the ocean.” 
<p></p>
I could’ve guessed he relied upon me so much. After all, I’m the only other friend besides Penny that he visits randomly. 
<p></p>
“You’re, um, a constant to me, and I wanted to thank you.”
<p></p>
“Oh, you’re welcome.” I wondered whether that was all, but his expression made me uneasy. His brows kept skewing, quivering slightly. Then he looked away and sighed.
<p></p>
I built up a question myself, while double checking that my own forehead was relaxed, free of the slight crease that sometimes appeared above my brow. “Are you worried about something?”
<p></p>
His brows raised further upwards, then he straightened his face out and looked serious. 
<p></p>
He finally asked, “Well, E, would you want to go out with me?”
<p></p>
My stomach felt like it was the ocean, only being forced into a small sphere. Not only is my newest job occupying 6 days of the week, but he’s a friend to me to the same degree as Penny and sometimes I doubt we’ve ever had a conversation. All I know is that he is certain and I am not.
<p></p>
I told him I’d think about it. 
<p></p>
He left with a side hug and a grin. Penny texted me later, and as soon as I told her he’d visited, she surprised me:
<p></p>
<i>Oh, did he come over to at last reveal his friendship had turned romantic??</i>
<p></p>
She knew he was going to ask, possibly encouraged him. I wonder if she knows how a stomach can feel like a contained ocean.
<p></p>
Getting sleepy now, signing off.
</p>

OCT - 14
<p>
Right now I’m at home with Daniel. I normally wouldn’t write today but I suddenly won’t have work tomorrow, or for the next few days.
<p></p>
I began the day as usual, with egg, toast, tea, and checking train schedules. Daniel texted me:
<p></p>
Hey E, I really want to see you and talk. are you free after work?
<p></p>
I agreed, as I was getting off a bit early today.
<p></p>
Catching the morning train from Long Beach to Los Angeles was smooth and practically noiseless, besides the boarding announcements, as normal. Everyone dedicated to their own Datanows. (I've begun to recognize this man in a plain suit who sits at a bench, watching the arrival times as if expecting a train. I find it strange, since I've never seen him actually board a train. Yet, as I headed home today, he wasn’t there.)
<p></p>
Daniel lives in Huntington Beach, so it only takes him a couple stops and a short walk to travel to my place, which is only a block from the station. I was in the middle of preparing dinner when he knocked on the door. His long legs awkwardly bent to put his arm around my shoulder, then I returned to frying some spices for vegetarian curry. Leaning to the stove, he gave me a smile of suppressed affection.
<p></p>
“Would you like any help? It smells delicious.”

"Sure, you can chop carrots.” I handed him a couple carrots and pointed to the knife.
<p></p>
Then it struck. 
<p></p>
My half-empty can of tomatoes jumped off the shaking countertop and hit the floor. Daniel yelled out then crouched down. I dove next to the coffee table and covered my head. The building let out a few cracking sounds, which I knew would leave greater marks on the stucco facade now, if it was not already in pieces. All my dishware clinked, and the ones on open cupboards tripped off the shelves and onto the tile floor. 
<p></p>
I wondered whether Daniel was hit by any of the glass. Remaining low to the ground, which was beginning to feel as if it were wooden planks tumbling on an ocean, I crawled over to peer at him. His face was still buried in his lap; I could only see his thick black hair, speckled with debris. 
<p></p>
Gradually, the earth solidified again and we hesitantly stood up to observe the impact. We checked the EARTHNOW NEWS. A calm-faced woman with bright red lipstick stated that a 6.0 magnitude earthquake had damaged several business buildings downtown, countless homes, and the train station. Some power lines were down, but most houses have local generators that will last about a week; they’d been installed even before EARTHDATA existed out of foresight for disaster. Then two of EARTHDATA’s representatives joined the news woman, and they all sat around a glass-topped table, as is the custom of news discussion. They explained that headquarters was looking into systems at LA HQ, as there must have been a misreading of tectonic shifts, but it had happened before. With a reassuring smile and a shrug, one representative said that nature does what it wants. There will be an increased amount of work hours for those still able to commute to the centers. Everyone else can only do remote Data Requests, or else find local jobs to keep busy. 
<p></p>
Daniel will sleep on my couch for awhile. The bus system is still running but incredibly packed due to demand, so he gladly took up my offer. 

<p></p>

<p></p>
I found a sticky note in my palm this morning, with pairs of unlikely word combinations scribbled in a column (see above). Probably sleep-writing again; I’ve written small poems in my sleep, most of which never made much sense, but that was a while ago.
<p></p>
I woke up today to some data workers drilling the concrete several houses down. It was painfully jarring, but I was grateful at least my own position didn’t make me work on the street, especially after a disaster. 
Thankfully, the damage wasn't enough to break water lines, so I can still take showers.
<p></p>
They are predicting further earthquakes by next week, of lesser magnitude. The city has barely reacted; no one has been reported injured, no public chaos. I suppose it’s unlikely anything worse would happen, as EARTHDATA has prevented the most serious natural catastrophes. Yet how much do they actually know? It's odd this one slipped past their devices. When I asked him what he thought, Daniel reiterated to me with a tone of intelligence what the reporters had said, that it’s natural for mistakes such as this. Maybe I'm overreacting. Yet, my stomach-sphere reformed when I walked to the store today. I noted that every building has a major crack, a dramatic cut across each store front. No one can commute out of town since the trains are still down, so when I’m not with Penny or Daniel, I've been keeping busy doing Remote Data Requests. The twitching in my arm has just started up again, and making writing this difficult. 
<p></p>
Since we’re both less occupied now, Penny and I met up at our habitual coffee place this afternoon. I gathered up an outfit and headed to the cafe which is only a few blocks from either of our houses. Thankfully the Sahara Cafe is still running despite their own fractured walls, as they serve the only decaf lattes worth drinking. Setting myself at a two-person table in a corner, with my back to a navy-blue wall, I faced towards a window framed with green tape. I stared into the foam and let my eyes rest. 
<p></p>
“Esse, you look like a Diebenkorn painting.” Penny was holding a black coffee in a wide ceramic cup in one gracefully strong hand while pulling her chair out with the other. 
<p></p>
“Oh, really?” I smiled dumbly, but I could easily envision the exact piece she meant; I’d stared at it when I visited San Francisco last holiday. 
<p></p>
“You know, <i>Woman and Coffee</i> or something like that.” 
<p></p>
She sat down and leaned forward, her dark eyes directed straight into mine. While most of her features are like a warm, bright day, her eyes are oddly deep and intense. 
<p></p>
“So how are you handling this? Have you talked to him about it yet?”
 <p></p>
“I’m fine, no not yet.” I turned away, gazing at the confection case that resembled a Wayne Thiebaud piece. She could have been blended into the scene as well, like the strangely stark women that sometimes stood behind his thickly painted counters.
<p></p>
“Hmm. It would be best to tell him soon.”
<p></p>
“Yeah.” I felt a surge of anxiety dive into my core. I also hadn’t told her that Daniel is currently staying at my house. Before I could decide whether I’d like her to know, Penny began again.
<p></p>
“I always thought you two had a bond, or at least inside jokes I never understood. And you know his parents.” 
<p></p>
It is true, she hasn't met them yet. They were similar to Daniel, with high expectations obvious in the stares they give you. I could feel the sphere again, shrinking. 
<p></p>
“What’s that odd face about?”
<p></p>
“Oh, my coffee is already lukewarm.” I took a sip and blinked.
<p></p>
“Sorry I kept you waiting. Have an influx of Data Projects this week.”
She sipped her own coffee and stared off, allowing an intermission of a few minutes. The sphere rolled around as I waited for her next words.
<p></p>
“I do hope you’re ok, Esse. It must be strange, as you practically lost a best friend. Remember you can call me whenever you need reassurance or guidance on anything, or just a person around.”
<p></p>
“Thanks Penny, I really am fine.” I swallowed my last drop of coffee. Besides the sphere, my stomach felt hollow. 
<p></p>
“Alright.” That was the end of her motherly advice for the day. Thankfully, she set the topic aside and I relaxed a bit.
<p></p>
“Did you ever end up listening to the Impromptu piano works of Schubert?”
<p></p>
I nodded and formed my hands to a perfect circle around the base. Her and Daniel have distinct music tastes. She surrounds me by her preference of classical classics - Tchaikovsky, Shastokovich, Schubert, Brahms, and Debussy. Daniel pulls me in the other direction, introducing me to obscure punk rock bands and inviting me to small shows throughout downtown. Lately though, I’ve been replaying music that you’d probably find on an elevator, or in a hotel lobby. Plain stuff that never really asks to be listened to, and doesn’t have much of a melody. 
<p></p>
“He was quite extraordinary - did I ever tell you how he composed his works? He stopped using a piano, just wrote the notes straight on the sheets. So crazy and talented, he thought the piano got in the way. I couldn’t imagine working without my piano equivalent, skipping an outline before writing anything.” 
<p></p>
Penny has been generating articles for EARTHNOW JOURNAL for probably 4 years, covering philosophy and everything related in her direct and intense style. 
<p></p>
“Not everyone works like Schubert,” I remarked with a thoughtful expression, trying to remember whether my latest favorite track had any piano in it.
<p></p>
“Very true.”
<p></p>
OCT - 20 - part 1
<p></p>
Daniel is currently out Field Collecting but he has been restless. It's good that he can continue to work around Long Beach for now. I’ve been making most of our meals since he never really learned how to cook, but he took upon making breakfast this morning before he left. He overcooked the eggs and spilled some tea, but he seemed to need the activity. As he placed the mismatched salvaged plates across the table, he looked nervously at me so I smiled warmly and posed with my fork to express my thanks. He paused with his eyes cast down, appearing to analyze the pale yellow yolk.
<p></p>
“You never gave me a response to my question. I know you don’t talk much, but I’d like to know. The uncertainty might make this unexpected sleepover unbearable for me.”
<p></p>
I think my face went blank. I still didn’t know. I was lost in the middle-brown shade of my tea, which was contained in a washed out metal can. I lifted it to my lips and revived my smile.
<p></p>
“Where’d you like to go?”
<p></p>
OCT - 16 - part 2
<p></p>
(Back from going out with Daniel this evening)
<p></p>
When Daniel returned from collecting, he suggested we go to the Cantonese restaurant that’s a 20 minute walk away, since I’ve talked about their comforting soup before and it hadn’t been damaged by the quakes. Once again I noted how many new breaks in the sidewalk I stepped over. 
<p></p>
While he inspected the menu (I already knew what to order) I stared at our water glasses. They were beginning to slosh. Gradually the whole building followed, and we dove to the floor - this time, Daniel took his arms around me and used his jacket to cover us both. It felt like there were two earthquakes happening - one around us and one inside me. You could hear all the dishes and silverware clinking, liquids splashing, people yelping. I focused on the patterned carpet; I let my eyes trace the designs that reminded me of Hilma Klint paintings. After it calmed, I remained there for a couple minutes, and Daniel did as well. He turned to look at me. Clearly he enjoyed holding me like this. But then, his expression altered to concern, and he patted my shoulder.
<p></p>
“You’re still shaking. Are you okay? That one really scared you, huh?”
<p></p>
I mumbled an ‘mm.’ I noticed we were separated by a yellow, curling line printed on the carpet. 
<p></p>
I wasn’t thinking about the earthquake, but I couldn’t stop trembling for awhile. He helped me up and a waitress went around the tables giving free coffee and tea. Most things were still intact, so we continued with our order while checking the news. 4.1, with an epicenter once again in Long Beach. There was no news on earthquakes happening elsewhere on the whole continent. It’s fortunate our city was reinforced with stabilizers and generators. Are they really just hitting us only? Daniel would immediately dismiss it, but I’m beginning to doubt the EARTHNEWS. He didn’t talk about today’s event for the rest of our date, only thoroughly explained how to measure gravitational pull and about the Earth-Core equipment that has officially passed field testing, and will soon be implemented in labs. 
<p></p>
My eyes are closing on their own, signing off.
<p></p>
<img src="images/dataglobe.svg" id="logo">
<p></p>
I pushed aside the refrigerator to examine myself in the mirror. Last night’s earthquake had rearranged the house into an Escher spectacle and relocated it several islands away, but everything inside was still here. My right shoulder was still out of place, making my silhouette appear constantly leaning to the side. 
<p></p>
The mirror shrunk with a clink and attached to my wristband, the surface becoming pixelated like a digital wrist watch. It beeped and digital letters scrolled across the screen: <i>GOOD MIDNIGHT EZR-</i> when the second earthquake began. Grabbing onto the kitchen sink, I twisted my wrist and heard the screen crack slightly, and instinctively let go. The world shook me out the window, sending me past the mansions, airports, grocery stores, and neighborhoods, all unempathetic and distant as crisply-painted dollhouses. 
<p></p>
I finally landed in a gridded space that resembled a desperately clean white-tiled bathroom. Ahead of me, a path of green-and-blue tiles began, and led me to a dimly lit, curving escalator. As I descended, the tiles spread above me to become a bright blue day lined with greenery, that seemed to embrace me with familiarity. When I reached the bottom, the escalator froze, and I realized I was at my 27th office. 
<p></p>
A few steps in front of me a narrow creek, or used-to-be-creek, since it was now a dried pathway of dusty rocks, encircled a willow tree. Flowing from the tree, a bedroom-size veil of branches hung heavily, starved of a breeze. I pushed aside the veil and entered the office. I blinked and hardly recognized it, as it had become a sort of storage space for all kinds of office things, being crowded with dressers, files, paper towers, books, boxes, a computer, printer, and a desk with an irrational amount of pens. 
<p></p>
Pushing aside some boxes, I pulled out my notebook and stubby pencil and began cataloguing what I found. I couldn’t help but notice the stacks of literature were very outdated and overused. Torn, yellowed editions of Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice, and Much Ado About Nothing. I was skimming the last pages of an edition of The Tale of Two Cities, when something shuffled around. Thinking it was in the desk, I pulled open the drawer and pushed things around but couldn’t find it. As I bent underneath and touched the back panel, it shook again with more clarity; it was inside a hidden compartment behind the panel. With closer inspection, I noticed a keyhole, centered in a brass oval about thumb-size, and a sapphire glass knob attached below. Keys were nowhere in clear sight, so I impatiently yanked at the knob, to no avail. Pressing my face against the worn wooden surface, I tried to simply listen. The contents gently shook the whole desk and my head which was now connected to it, and something like the trapped wind in a seashell moved inside.
<p></p>

</p><p>
This morning my face was buzzing and my mind was fully conscious, but my hands had gone numb from holding my arms above my head all night. I pulled them down and had to stretch my fingers until I knew they were mine again. I received another note from my asleep self, which I transcribed above.
</p><p>
I turned my body to slide my feet off the bed and stand up. I stuck the note on the mirror and found my face. I felt slightly more fatigued than usual and tried to remember if my dream had been exhausting. Nothing but a curtain of black came to mind; I haven’t had any dreams ever since moving to my apartment last year, and before that they were all about your typical, stress-inducing events. I’ve shown up to graduation wearing only a shirt, been late for every train to the airport, and crashed every car I drove - so I am not sad to dream of pure darkness. I continued gazing at my reflection, trying to remember if I’d always been this pale. The features remind me of a set of ceramic. Like plain dishware for one, the eyebrows neatly rest above the eyes, which are placed at the sides of the moderately smooth nose, all laid out on a predictably shaped table of the face. Only my ears disrupt the still life, like a last minute addition to contribute some conceptual emphasis, they noticeably stick out on either side.
</p><p>
I met Penny at the park since we still can’t go to work today. We rolled out our mats on a slight hill next to a tree. For awhile she sat and stared at the tree, so I followed her gaze to the branches, but nothing stopped my eye. I stood perpendicular to my mat and pulled myself upwards, with my hands raised and pressed together, and tilted my head back to squint at the sky. There were perhaps four birds at the park today, all up in trees surrounding the edges of the park, occasionally letting a cry to define the boundaries in short chirps.
</p><p>
“I’ve enjoyed this unexpected break; it’s important to just breathe outside, in nature, once in awhile.”
</p><p>
The air was pushed out of my lungs from the bending of my spine, so I mumbled a ‘mhm’.
</p><p>
“Everything makes sense when you stare at the trees and birds long enough. Have you talked to Daniel yet? I called him briefly a few days ago, but he seemed terribly distant.”
</p><p>
I straightened then reversed my bend, so my face touched my knees. My arm began its spasmodic twitching again. “I have.” 
</p><p>
She watched me unfold myself over the mat, then rise into a downward dog. Except I felt unbalanced with the single shaking arm.
</p><p>
“You accepted him, right?” Her fingers, unguided by her eyes, began to wander to the edges of her notebook.
</p><p>
As I shifted weight forwards into an upward dog, only a few inches above the ground but trembling to keep myself from falling, I nodded yes, gently. 
</p><p>
“I’m glad for you. I’m certain he’d do anything to keep you in his life, even attempt your stretching routine. Speaking of routines, I need to reread this week’s article aloud, if you wouldn’t mind being my second pair of ears.”
</p><p>
Of course I didn’t mind; I am used to hearing her final drafts. If I said I’d prefer otherwise, she’d convince me to listen anyways. Flipping open her notebook, which was worn with curling edges and warped pages, she began by delving into a question about the source of personality and individuality, gradually shifting from various viewpoints - from the scientific view, Christian view, Muslim view, Hindu view, and on. I watched her pinch the terribly misshapen pages, occasionally interrupting to smooth them out and cause a wave of crinkling protest.
</p><p>
Resting my body on the ground, I bent my legs back to connect my feet to my head. Flexibility is one of my achievements. It’s a combination of my natural plasticity and ability to do the same thing every day, regardless if progress is noticeable. Penny continued on, separating internal and external characteristics in the air, tapping on her notebook for emphasis.  
 </p><p>
“In the words of Lafcadio Hearn, <i>‘I an individual—an individual soul! Nay, I am a population—a population unthinkable for multitude, even by groups of a thousand millions! Generations of generations I am, aeons of aeons!’</i> With or without a soul, our traits are developed by a multitude of past voices, and, if we agree on the Law of the Conservation of Mass, our physical bodies have an infinity in each corner. We are a center of energy gathered from ages of deterioration and growth, containing the blood, diet, dust of our ancestors and other organisms, and a worldview that contains the time-altered whispers of their ideas. Adding a soul, there is an entirely new dimension that we can never see, with no physical nature or location even as it is attached to us.”
</p><p>
My mind wandered as I observed the playground near to us. The slide had been dislocated from its frame and the plastic structure was disjointed. There was a line of tape around everything, with a polite sign near a ladder telling visitors to remain off the play structure until officials had repaired it.   
</p><p>
“While the soul may exist, there is no way for us to study it. No one wonder why most scientists reject it.”
</p><p>
I turned back to Penny. She was again gazing outward, obviously not thinking about trees or skies or birds, probably not even anything tangible.
</p><p>
“Have you ever pictured the soul?” 
</p><p>
She tilted her head as she waited for my response. I kept my arms and legs still in the full sunlight. 
The soul has to be intangible, but perhaps it has physical effects. I shook my head.
</p><p>
I allowed my spine to merge with the mat, which was formed to the soft ground; I was a part of the act of being a perfectly arching hill in the earthquake-misshapen park.  
</p><p>
“Hmm. If it was able to be visually represented, I imagine it to be paradoxical - such as a house that has walls but never ends.”
</p><p>
I didn’t even nod this time. The birds were slowly getting out of sync, singing at random and at overlapping times, so it was hard to sort their voices out anymore.

</p><p>

<p></p>
S // 19
<p></p>

There was hardly any light wherever we were, only the glow of a palm-size lantern and what leaked through the edges of the cabinet door. I squinted at the girl who’d let me in. She appeared to be very young, possibly only 8 years old. Thick dust settled around us; this third earthquake had just tore down the blue tile sky above the 27th office, and probably others as well. Yet this place was almost entirely unaffected. It was peaceful, and felt as though we were outside due to the sense of open air. She whispered to me that it was safe here. I wouldn’t have been able to hear her if the place wasn’t oddly noiseless. As she lowered her lantern reflections bounced off the ground and I realized we were walking across a thin layer of inky water, less than ½ in deep. When I glanced up again, she was already in the distance, so I walked faster to catch up. The water splashed without sound. I followed her for about 2 hours, in complete silence, only broken by an occasional tremble of the ground which she ignored. <p></p>
Eventually we came to a perfectly circular and smooth rock that rose slightly above the water. She faced me then placed her lantern on the circle, which activated a secret line of light that revealed a pathway trailing into a cave. We followed the line of light as it wove through the tunnels. At last, we reached a dead end, and a semicircle of light, as if a thin moon was cut into the cave wall. She pushed on the inside of the curve, which opened and revealed a cozy, wood-furnished interior of a living room. There was someone else already sitting on the sofa, reading a very thick book that looked handmade, similar to my own. 
<p></p>
The girl who led me here stopped and I could see her face clearly at last. Her features were more defined than I expected, but still rosy. She blinked at me, and I leaned closer to hear what she was going to say.
<p></p>
“My name is Eliza. This,” pointing to the other girl, “is Elise.” Elise lowered her book to her lap and nodded. I waved slightly then sat opposite to her on a stool. Eliza carried out a tray with towers of shortbread cookies and arranged cups of tea. Elise suddenly placed down the book and looked directly at me.
<p></p>
“OK, so how much do you know about, well, everything? We haven’t got time for introductions.”
<p></p>
I remained quiet for a minute, but Elise didn’t turn away, like a school teacher questioning a student, so I quickly organized my thoughts. “Everything? To be honest I think I’m losing my mind, I don’t remember anything past a few weeks ago and what memories I do receive are like unfinished sentences.” It was true. Things are vaguely familiar, yet never make much sense. Then, the world began falling apart, incrementally. The only consistent thing is my journal, where I describe whatever recalls a memory. 
<p></p>
Elise reached out and tapped on my journal. I forgot I had it out on my lap.
<p></p>
“Can I see this?”
<p></p>
I was reluctant at first, but released my hold. She skimmed through it, and gave an all-knowing smile.

“Do you know why you write? Nevermind, I’ll tell you. She receives your notes. We know this since we used to be connected with Her as well, the protagonists of Her subconscious. But you’re it now, and this -” she slapped the book back into my hand, “is our communication device to reach Her.”

We had earth tremors today. 
<p></p>
I didn’t do any work but Daniel still has CRs, so I just tried writing a poem while he was out. Soon we’ll both be absorbed in our busy lives again, since officials are saying that trains will be working by tomorrow. When he came back, we gathered up things to go on a picnic at Earthwell Park. It’s a wide, expansive park, with a lake and a stream that cuts through, clusters of romantic willow trees, and a community garden providing a colorful display of flowers. Daniel and I sat on a blanket under a willow and ate the sandwiches and fruits I’d prepared. We were picking from a bowl of strawberries when the branches began to shake. Daniel was wrapped up around me again, despite the lack of ceilings or walls that could collapse on us. It felt unlike the previous ones; something was testing the ground, each tremor slightly different in movement. I counted the length of each; the first was 2 seconds, then 3, 5, 7, 5, and 3 - like a weird pattern. I thought there’d be another 2 second one, but it remained still. I turned to Daniel. He faced me and drew closer. 
<p></p>
I noticed my arm was twitching again, and I was slightly shaking. Ever since the first earthquake my center-sphere has not regained it original composure. The anxiety is freely running through my veins. I know Daniel thinks I’m terrified, despite that I’ve calmly denied it. I shake even when the ground is stable; earlier, we were walking through the flowers and I couldn’t make it stop. He held my hand when he noticed it, and explained the directional relationships between the tectonic plates and EARTHDATA’s unfailing ability to keep them at peace in an effort to ease me.
<p></p>
As he drew close to me on the blanket, I realized he wanted to kiss me. I was unsure. I knew it was a date, but I felt no romance. I pulled back slightly, which he noticed.
<p></p>
“Thinking about EARTHDATA again? Forget about them. We have each other, right?” He said, combing my hair.
<p></p>
I smiled and let him kiss me.

OCT - 23 - part 1
<p></p>
I don’t understand. I’m surrounded by collapsed walls and floors, the station is in rubble, and electricity is unreliable, due to generators being damaged. And still I can see out of this little break room window that people are casually walking down the street, focused on their Datanows. The news calmly explained it as a 6.0, recoverable disaster. I called Penny and Daniel to check in with them, and they clearly believed it. 
I don’t anymore. Whatever EARTHNEWS reports to us, it is not aligning with what I’m experiencing. 
<p></p>
This morning I prepared for my second day back at the office since last week. Daniel wanted to stay a bit longer with me, as he has been concerned about my nervous tremors. I think he’s afraid I’ll collapse too. I also think I am beginning to get used to our relationship. He kissed me at the station, before I boarded my train. I just realized, I hadn’t seen the plain man on the bench today. Yet I did yesterday, which I find odd. 
<p></p>
At work, I received a tsunami of Data Sorting to do, so I immediately entered the Datanow Reality-to-System Room, and remained through my lunch break and a few hours overtime. I almost finished the overdue assignments, but before I could, all the data suddenly faded and disappeared. I stepped out and everything began to shake violently. I stumbled to the floor, and crawled under a desk. There was no shouting, just cracking and crashing sounds as lights flashed and dust piled up. 
<p></p>
Now I’m in the break room, wondering what to do next. Most of the ground is a maze of insulation rubble. No one works overtime anymore, so I’m probably alone. Anyways, I didn’t hear any voices or movement. Or whoever was here is crushed now. Maybe it was lucky I was doing Sorting today, since the desks are newer and sturdier in the DNRS room than around the Systems office.  
<p></p>
I’m shaking, but the twitching is gone. Now to decide what to do. I think I’ll try to find my way down and out of the building. I’ve never walked around the streets here, but perhaps they still have B&Bs, if they are not crumbling.
<p></p>
OCT - 23 - part 2
<p></p>
I knew this place was a feat of architecture, about the size of a small town in which you never need to go outside, since even the station is connected through a concrete tunnel (which is probably destroyed now). Yet I cannot exit the building, or find the exit. I did find that Datanews HQ is the next division over within this structure, so I found myself wandering down the hallways which were unblocked by debris. I haven’t been interrupted by any other curious victims; it seems everyone cleared out at their shift’s end. As I made my way down the half-lit corridors, it hit me that this was my chance to resolve my suspicions.<p></p>
The interiors remind me of an outdated airport, although without any stores. Instead, there is an occasional door, windowless and labeled with dark green numbers. All were locked, and made a dense metal sound when I tapped on them. At last I came to a door which was unhinged and leaning off the frame. It was not numbered, but instead had ‘EARTHNEWS SR Room’ written on the label. I do RS, so SR would mean System-to-Reality. Which is odd, and could be the evidence I’m searching for. Now I am staring the equipment inside. It looks identical to my own - the Immersion Box is attached with metal rods to the ceiling, hovering near the System Desk. The only differences are the label, reading ENSR, and the chair, being deep green and in better condition than my own. It is still on - a dot of light on the box flashes in saturated red. 

<p></p>
Daniel or Penny might try to believe me, for the sake of empathy, but they love their jobs. They’d never be able to risk it. I’m going to enter the DNSR - wish me luck.
